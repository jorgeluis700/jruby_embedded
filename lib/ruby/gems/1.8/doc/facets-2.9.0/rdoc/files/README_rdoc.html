&quot;ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO RUBY&quot;
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Ruby Facets is the premiere collection of general purpose method extensions
and standard additions for the Ruby programming language.
</p>
<p>
Facets houses the largest single collection of methods available for
extending the core capabilities of Ruby&#8216;s built-in classes and
modules. This collection of extension methods are unique by virtue of their
atomicity. The methods are stored in individual files so that each can be
required independently. This gives developers the potential for much finer
control over which extra methods to bring into their code.
</p>
<p>
In addition Facets provides a collection of extensions to Ruby standard
library plus a small collection of add-on classes and modules. Together
these libraries constitute an ever improving source of reusable components,
suitable to a wide variety of usecases.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Facets has special documentation needs due to it&#8216;s extensive bredth.
The RDocs generated when installing via RubyGems are unweildly because it
combines all of Facets in one set of docs. (Hopefully we can remedy this in
the future). In the mean time better organized online documentation is
available at <a
href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/learn.html">rubyworks.github.com/facets/learn.html</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Core API: <a
href="http://rubyworks/github.com/facets/doc/api/core/index.html">rubyworks/github.com/facets/doc/api/core/index.html</a>

</li>
<li>More API: <a

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.
</p>
<pre>
  $ gem install facets
</pre>
<p>
To install manually, your will need Ruby Setup (<a
href="http::/setup.rubyforge.org">:/setup.rubyforge.org</a>). Then download
and unpack the .tar.gz package and run:
</p>
<pre>
  $ tar -xvzf facets-2.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd facets-2.x.x
  $ sudo setup.rb
</pre>
<p>
Facets 2.8+ requires Ruby 1.8.7 or higher.
</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
Facets holds to the notion that the more we can reasonably integrate into a
common foundation, directed toward general needs, the better that
foundation will be able to serve the community. There are a number of
advantages here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Better Code-reuse

</li>
<li>Collaborative Improvements

</li>
<li>Greater Name Consistency

</li>
<li>One-stop Shop and Installation

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>CORE Library</h3>
<p>
At the heart of Ruby Facets is the CORE extensions library. CORE provides a
sizable collection of generally useful methods, along with a few supporting
classes, that extend the functionality of Ruby&#8216;s core classes and
modules.
</p>
<p>
By definition CORE contains anything that will load automatically when
issuing:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
If you plan to use more then a few of Facets core method it is recommended
that you require the main facility.
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This loads all the CORE functionality at once.
</p>
<p>
Of course you can use the CORE library piecemeal if you prefer. The general
require statement for a core extensions library is:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/&lt;class|module&gt;/&lt;method-lib&gt;'
</pre>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/time/stamp'
</pre>
<p>
Most &quot;atoms&quot; contain only one method, but a few exceptions occur
when methods are closely tied together.
</p>
<p>
You can load per-class or per-module groups of core methods by requiring
the class or module by name. For example&quot;
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/time'
</pre>
<p>
Will require all the core <a href="../classes/Time.html">Time</a> method
extensions.
</p>
<p>
Note that some methods that were part of CORE in 1.8 and earlier are now
part of MORE libraries. A good example is &#8216;random.rb&#8217;. There
were separated because they had more specialized use cases, where as CORE
extensions are intended as general purpose.
</p>
<p>
This is the recommended usage. However, you can also &quot;cherry
pick&quot; core methods. While there are exceptions the rule of thumb for
loading a core method is:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/{class|module}/{method}'
</pre>
<h4><a href="../classes/Method.html">Method</a> <a href="../classes/File.html">File</a> Names</h4>
<p>
Operator method redirect files are stored using English names. For instance
for <a href="../classes/Proc.html">Proc</a>#* is &#8216;proc/op_mul&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
For reference, here is the chart.
</p>
<pre>
     +@   =&gt; op_plus
     -@   =&gt; op_minus
     +    =&gt; op_add
     -    =&gt; op_sub
     **   =&gt; op_pow
     *    =&gt; op_mul
     /    =&gt; op_div
     %    =&gt; op_mod
     ~    =&gt; op_tilde
     &lt;=&gt;  =&gt; op_cmp
     &lt;&lt;   =&gt; op_lshift
     &gt;&gt;   =&gt; op_rshift
     &lt;    =&gt; op_lt
     &gt;    =&gt; op_gt
     ===  =&gt; op_case
     ==   =&gt; op_equal
     =~   =&gt; op_apply
     &lt;=   =&gt; op_lt_eq
     &gt;=   =&gt; op_gt_eq
     |    =&gt; op_or
     &amp;    =&gt; op_and
     ^    =&gt; op_xor
     []=  =&gt; op_store
     []   =&gt; op_fetch
</pre>
<p>
Facets simply takes the &#8217;*&#8217; and translates it into a string
acceptable to all file systems. Also, if a method ends in &#8217;=&#8217;,
&#8217;?&#8217; or &#8217;!&#8217; it is simply removed.
</p>
<h3>MORE Library</h3>
<p>
On top of the extensive Core library, Facet provides a small collection of
additional modules and classes, as well as extended versions of modules and
classes in Ruby&#8216;s Standard library.
</p>
<p>
Use the More library like you would any other 3rd party library. The only
difference between Facets More library and other libraries is the lack of
any enclosing @Facets::@ namespace. This is becuase the libraries provided
by Facets are considerd fairly low-level.
</p>
<p>
When using Facets&#8217; extended versions of Ruby&#8216;s standard
libraries, the More libraries have to loaded manually, of course. However
you do not need to load Ruby&#8216;s library first, as the Facets&#8217;
library will do that automatically.
</p>
<p>
For example, normally one load Ruby&#8216;s <a
href="../classes/OpenStruct.html">OpenStruct</a> class via:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'ostruct'
</pre>
<p>
To load &#8216;ostruct.rb&#8217; plus Facets extensions for it simply use:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/ostruct'
</pre>
<p>
instead.
</p>
<p>
Using the Facets/MORE library of modules, classes or microframeworks is
essentially the same. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/basicobject'
</pre>
<p>
Again, for details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please
see the API Docs.
</p>
<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>
This project thrives on contribution.
</p>
<p>
If you have any extension methods, classes, modules or small frameworks
that you think have general applicability and would like to see them
included in this project, don&#8216;t hesitiate to submit. Also, if you
have better versions of any thing already included or simply have a patch,
they are more than welcome. We want Ruby Facets to be of the highest
quality.
