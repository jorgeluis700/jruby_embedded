  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Opens a file as a string and writes back the string to the file at the end of the block.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Returns the number of written bytes or <tt>nil</tt> if the file wasn't modified.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Note that the file will even be written back in case the block raises an exception.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Mode can either be &quot;b&quot; or &quot;+&quot; and specifies to open the file in binary mode (no mapping of the plattform's newlines to &quot;\n&quot; is done) or to append to it.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Assuming we had a file 'message.txt' and had a binary file 'binary.dat'.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  # Reverse contents of &quot;message.txt&quot;\n  File.rewrite(&quot;tmp/message.txt&quot;) { |str| str.reverse }\n\n  # Replace &quot;foo&quot; by &quot;bar&quot; in &quot;binary.dat&quot;.\n  File.rewrite(&quot;tmp/binary.dat&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) { |str| str.gsub(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;) }\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "IMPORTANT: The old version of this method required in place modification of the file string. The new version will write whatever the block returns instead!!!"
