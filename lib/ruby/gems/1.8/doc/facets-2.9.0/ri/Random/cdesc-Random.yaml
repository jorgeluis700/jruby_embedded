  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This library extends Array, String, Hash and other classes with randomization methods. Most of the methods are of one of two kinds. Either they &quot;pick&quot; a random element from the reciever or they randomly &quot;shuffle&quot; the reciever.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The most common example is Array#shuffle, which simply randmomizes the order of an array's elements.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  [1,2,3].shuffle  #~&gt; [2,3,1]\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The other methods do similar things for their respective classes.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The classes are all extended via mixins which have been created within Ruby's Random class.

    body: "NOTE: Inline QED tests are almost pointless here b/c... yea, it's random. So indtead of the usual `#=&gt;` we use `#~&gt;` which means approx. equal and prevens QED from making a hard assertion."
