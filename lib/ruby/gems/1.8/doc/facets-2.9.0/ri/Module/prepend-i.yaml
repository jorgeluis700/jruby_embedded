  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "IMPORTANT! #prepend is not dynamic, rather it copies all methods when included on a class or module. For this reason one must be careful to invoke #prepend AFTER any method definitions that are to be effected. Ideally this would not be necessary, but it would require support in Ruby's C+ source to make it possible."
