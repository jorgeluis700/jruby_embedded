    body: Require file into module/class namespace.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Unlike load this keeps a per-module cache and will not load the same file into the same module more than once despite repeated attempts.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The cache is kept in a global var called +$module_require+.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Please use this with careful consideration. It is best suited to loading plugin-type scripts, and should generally not be used as a substitue for Ruby's standard load system.
