    body: "Allows the initialization of an OpenStruct with a setter block:"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  person = OpenStruct.new do |o|\n    o.name    = 'John Smith'\n    o.gender  = :M\n    o.age     = 71\n  end\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: You can still provide a hash for initialization purposes, and even combine the two approaches if you wish.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  person = OpenStruct.new(:name =&gt; 'John Smith', :age =&gt; 31) do |p|\n    p.gender = :M\n  end\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "Alternatively you can provide a default block:"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  stuff = OpenStruct.new{ |o,k| o[k] = [] }\n  stuff.place &lt;&lt; :a\n  stuff.place &lt;&lt; :b\n  stuff.place #=&gt; [:a, :b]\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: A setter block versus a defualt block is determined by the arity of the block. You can not provide both at the same time.
